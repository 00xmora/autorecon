# AutoRecon

AutoRecon is a powerful automated reconnaissance tool designed to simplify the process of subdomain enumeration, URL discovery, and website inspection. It integrates multiple tools like `amass`, `subfinder`, `sublist3r`, `httpx`, `ffuf`, `waybackurls`, `katana`, `waymore`, `crawley`, and `aquatone` to provide a comprehensive reconnaissance workflow.

## Features

### Subdomain Enumeration:
- Passive enumeration using `amass`, `subfinder`, and `sublist3r`.
- Active enumeration using `ffuf`.

### Live Domain Filtering:
- Filters live domains using `httpx`.

### URL Discovery:
- Discovers URLs using `waybackurls`, `katana`, `waymore`, and `crawley`.

### Visual Inspection:
- Inspects results using `aquatone`.

### Parallel Execution:
- Runs multiple tools in parallel for faster results.

### Organized Output:
- Saves results in a structured directory for each domain.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Linux-based system (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, Kali Linux).
- Python 3 and `pip` installed.
- Go installed for tools like `subfinder`, `httpx`, and `ffuf`.

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/autorecon.git
   cd autorecon
2. Make the installation script executable:

   chmod +x install.sh

3. Run the installation script:
      ```bash
    ./install.sh
    
## Usage
   Run the autorecon.sh script with a project name and one or more domains:
   ```bash 
   ./autorecon.sh MyProject domain1.com domain2.com
   ```
## Output
   The results will be saved in the following directory structure:
   ```bash
    MyProject/
    â”œâ”€â”€ domain1.com/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ amass.txt
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ subfinder.txt
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sublist3r.txt
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ domains.txt
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ domain.live
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ffuf.txt
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ domains
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ wayback.txt
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ katana.txt
