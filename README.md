# AutoRecon

AutoRecon is a powerful automated reconnaissance tool designed to simplify the process of subdomain enumeration, URL discovery, and website inspection. It integrates multiple tools like `amass`, `subfinder`, `sublist3r`, `httpx`, `ffuf`, `waybackurls`, `katana`, `waymore`, `crawley`, and `aquatone` to provide a comprehensive reconnaissance workflow.

## Features

### Subdomain Enumeration:
- Passive enumeration using `amass`, `subfinder`, and `sublist3r`.
- Active enumeration using `ffuf`.

### Live Domain Filtering:
- Filters live domains using `httpx`.

### URL Discovery:
- Discovers URLs using `waybackurls`, `katana`, `waymore`, and `crawley`.

### Visual Inspection:
- Inspects results using `aquatone`.

### Parallel Execution:
- Runs multiple tools in parallel for faster results.

### Organized Output:
- Saves results in a structured directory for each domain.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Linux-based system (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, Kali Linux).
- Python 3 and `pip` installed.
- Go installed for tools like `subfinder`, `httpx`, and `ffuf`.

### Installation Steps
